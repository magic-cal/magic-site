As a previous performer at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, I'm excited to bring my latest show to The Fringe. With two previous shows under my belt as part of a company plus a sold-out debut one-man free fringe show, I have honed my craft and have what it takes to deliver a captivating performance.

The show is a unique combination of classic magic and cutting-edge technology, which sets it apart from other performances at the festival. With my expertise in close-up magic and sleight of hand, combined with emerging technology, I'm confident that my show will offer an impressive and unique experience.

This new show builds on the success of my previous performances, using many of the same tested concepts and structure while adding even more technology-focused magic to the mix.
